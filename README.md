## üìä Data Visualization with Seaborn

All the projects in this repository leverage the power of **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)** ‚Äî a Python data visualization library built on top of matplotlib. Seaborn is known for its simplicity, beautiful default styles, and the ability to create complex plots with minimal code.

### ‚ú® Why Seaborn?
- Clean and **aesthetic visualizations** out of the box.
- Built-in support for **pandas DataFrames**.
- Easy to plot **statistical relationships**.
- Automatically handles **aggregation and bootstrapping**.
- Seamlessly integrates with **matplotlib** for customization.

### üìå Visualization Techniques Used:
The following Seaborn plot types are commonly used across the projects in this repo:

| Plot Type       | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sns.heatmap()` | Visualize correlation matrices or confusion matrices                    |
| `sns.boxplot()` | Show distribution and detect outliers                                   |
| `sns.barplot()` | Compare categorical values (with optional confidence intervals)         |
| `sns.lineplot()`| Visualize time series or trends over continuous data                    |
| `sns.pairplot()`| Plot pairwise relationships in a dataset                                |
| `sns.countplot()`| Show counts of observations in categorical data                        |
| `sns.scatterplot()`| Plot individual data points to show relationships and clustering     |
| `sns.violinplot()`| Combine boxplot and KDE to show distribution shape                    |

### üìÅ Projects Using Seaborn:
- **Project 1:** [HEALTHCARE] ‚Äì Heatmaps and pairplots used for EDA
- **Project 2:** [IRIS] ‚Äì Boxplots and barplots for comparing features
- **Project 3:** [SPORTS(FIFA)] ‚Äì Lineplots for analyzing trends over time
- *(And so on‚Ä¶ you can customize this list)*

### üîß Setup Instructions
If you're running the notebooks locally, make sure Seaborn is installed:

```bash
pip install seaborn
```
